## Abstract

The main propose of this exercise was detect the room walls from architectural blueprints or pre-construction plans. 
Two approaches were considered, but the focus shifted towards creating a room walls detection algorithm. This algorithm leverages image processing techniques specifically chosen for their ability to accentuate the boundaries of walls within an
pdf file.
